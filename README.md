# Web Security Vulnerability Scanner

This Python-based security vulnerability scanner, developed by **Striweb**, is designed to automate the process of identifying common web vulnerabilities in a given website. The tool tests for issues like missing security headers, rate limiting, brute-force login vulnerabilities, file upload weaknesses, CORS misconfigurations, HTTP parameter pollution, and open redirect flaws. Additionally, it performs subdomain enumeration to detect potential subdomains.

## Features

- **Security Headers Check:** Detects common security headers such as `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and others.
- **Rate Limiting Test:** Attempts multiple requests to detect rate limiting mechanisms.
- **Brute-Force Login Attack:** Tries common username/password combinations to identify weak login forms.
- **File Upload Vulnerability Test:** Simulates file uploads to detect improper handling of dangerous file types.
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP):** Tests if the server is vulnerable to parameter pollution attacks.
- **CORS Misconfiguration:** Detects if cross-origin resource sharing is misconfigured, which could expose sensitive data.
- **Open Redirect:** Checks if the website is vulnerable to open redirects, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Finds common subdomains associated with the target domain.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/striweb/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd web-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scanner.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **URL Input:** The script prompts for the URL of the website to test (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. **Subdomain Enumeration:** Automatically detects and tests subdomains like `www`, `admin`, `api`, etc.
3. **HTML Report Generation:** After running the tests, the tool generates a comprehensive HTML report, which can be saved to a specified file.

### Example

```bash
Enter the website URL to test (e.g., https://example.com): https://yourwebsite.com
Enter the file name to save the report (or press Enter to skip saving): report.html
```

The report will be saved as `report.html` in the current directory.

## Customization

- **XSS Payloads:** The scanner uses basic XSS payloads but can be extended by adding more sophisticated payloads to the `XSS_PAYLOADS` list.
- **Brute-Force Credentials:** Add more common username and password combinations to the `BRUTE_FORCE_CREDENTIALS` list.
- **File Upload Testing:** Modify the `files_to_test` dictionary to test for additional file types and formats.
